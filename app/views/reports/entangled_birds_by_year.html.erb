<h1>Entangled <%= params[:type] == "beach" ? "beaches" : "birds"%></h1>
<p>
Occasionally, COASST finds dead birds that are entangled in fishing line, hooks, net, or some other
man-made substance.  Fortunately, these are rare occurrences, but it is important to document these
incidents of human disturbance.  Data on entangled birds are presented in three ways:
</p>
<p>
First, by the type of entanglement, including the number of birds found entangled in each substance
and the percent of total entanglement incidents represented by each.  By clicking on a substance (e.g.
fishing line), you can get information about what species and where bird were found entangled in
fishing line.
</p>
<p>
Second, by species, including the total number of birds of each species that was found entangled
and the percent of all entangled birds represented by each species.
</p>
<p>
Third, by beach, including the total number of entangled birds found on each beach and the percent
of all birds found on that beach that were entangled.
</p>

  For a breakdown of entanglement data by year, please click the see species by year or see beaches
  by year links following the species and beach tables.
